*this system, no longer reverts you from being a vampire. the vampire archatype as a succssfull predator,
 is no longer the main threat to our civilisation. just an annoying element. people who could not read,
were being turned into vampires by not reading my message. so if you are a minority, such as a vampire,
you will need to manully input the code, V-Vampire. once. twice will turn you back into a vampire. {vvampire}

and for those who cannot read; I give you klettres, use it babyz! learn to read!!

Everyime I update this system, We Rob the Military of their precious HardDrive space. love it.
This time I am writing you to let you know of a feature you may not be aware of, GooglePlay "NODE"
Its the best I could do without having to manually make everyone a gmail account to run google play services
individually,I'm not sure how skull and bones made the normal play store work So I made it still 
dispense apps, but not keep tabs on them like it usually does
W3m https://play.google.com
it must be navigated through your browser, , heres the page, remember [play.google.com] install some apps or games,
You  have more space now...
